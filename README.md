Bass Bait and Catch Tracker

This programs allows a user to signup and login.  Once logged in they can add baits that they use to their profile. They can also create catches and log the catches to the baits that they have.  This allows the user to keep track of how many catches they have with each bait to see which baits works best for them. They can also individually look at each catch which has information about the fish.

A user is able to edit and delete both baits and catches. Note that if you delete a bait, then the catches and fish associated with it are also deleted.
